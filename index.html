          <p>A man of wit and many talents (and an odd habit of talking in third person, apparently),  Kayo Evetiouz is a jack of many trades when it comes to multimedia design.
            Being an artist is not always easy, especially in a world where they say art is dead, which might just explain why this particular artist is turning to satire and moderately
            witty commentary in an attempt to catch the attention of potential clients. Well, at least it's working; you're still here, after all. In any case, I think that's enough about me.
            If people were actually interested in the artist above the art I wouldn't have to turn to satire and fancy formulations to get your attention, right? Right. Below you will find a few
            fortes of mine, but be not fooled! I may or may not have a few tricks up my sleeve that are yet to be added to the repertoire. If at any point you feel intrigued, I strongly encourage
            you to contact me via the conveniently placed phone number or email address at the bottom of the page or within the contact page.</p>

              And I know what you're thinking: "What, this guy is actually using scientific research as part of his sales pitch now? He almost sounds like he
              knows what he's doing!" Almost. Well, don't read into it too much, it may just be a topic I happen to be vaguely passionate about. Now, scurry on
              over and listen to some of that sweet computer generate, midi orchestrated audio. Who knows? You may even be able to spot an actual instrument or two in there.  </p>

            <p>Sun Tzu once said: "if it can be written or thought, it can be filmed". Actually, now that I think about it, that might have been Kubrickâ€¦
              Anyway, everything is possible in the world of videography, is what I'm trying to say. You want to seem strong and stoic? Interesting or inspiring?
              Three inches taller? Well, you're in luck! Because all of that is possible with a few good camera angles, a solid script, and a just a pinch of post editing.  </p>

            <p>With a background in black and grey realism, there is (well almost) no limit to what this washed up failed artist can put onto the canvas.
              The once highly recognized tools of the trade such as brush and charcoal have been replaced by cold, hard  metal and computer programs in the
              thoroughly foreboding parallel to the artists' pending doom in the face of advancements inside the world of AI art software. Bummer.
              Well, if you at any time don't feel like feeding a cold, uncaring  algorithm words and images 'till one of you crashes, you know where to find me. </p>
